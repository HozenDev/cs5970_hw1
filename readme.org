* CS5970 - HW1 - Mini Project

** Project Overview

This project is a small nature-inspired haunted scene at night, created to fit the Halloween theme. I used assets from the Unity Asset Store, which include trees, wooden props, and pumpkins.

The project integrates teleportation locomotion and object grabbing functionality from the XR Toolkit. Players can grab pumpkins and place them on large barrels. When they do, the pumpkins light up!

The environment was built using Unityâ€™s Terrain Builder. I wanted to experiment with procedural, nature-based scenes, as this will be useful for our upcoming team project focused on evolving environments.

Various textures and 3D models were used for vegetation and props. All wooden elements include base color and normal maps to enhance realism.

** Setup Instructions

- Unity Version: 2022.1.62f LTS Version

Simply open the project in Unity Hub and press play, everything should run out of the box.

** Known Issues

Sometimes the pumpkins are difficult to grab, maybe due to the vegetation around making the raycast of the controller not founding the pumpkin.
